;;; When we perform an invocation, we can guess whether there is any possibility that we
;;; will actually handle any exception, or if we just need to clean up (if there is any cleanup).
;;; This is because the only exceptions we need to handle are the ones for BLOCK/TAGBODY.
;;; So we have two kinds of landing pads - one that checks the exception, and one that ignores it
;;; and cleans up and finally resumes.
;;; The second kind of pad is easy to organize. The landing pad stores the exn.slot and
;;; ehselector.slot and branches to an appropriate cleanup block. That block then branches to
;;; other cleanup blocks, etc., until the resume block is reached.
;;; For the first kind, we organize as follows. Each landing pad checks if the exception is our
;;; exception and if the frame is correct. If it isn't, we divert to the cleanup path. If it is,
;;; we follow a separate path. If the landing-pad is for a catch-instruction, it switches on the
;;; ID, transfers control if one matches, otherwise goes to the processor for the next landing
;;; pad. If the landing-pad is for a bind-instruction, it cleans up and then proceeds. At the end,
;;; rather than resuming, we signal an error (bug).
;;; We can use the ignorant, second type pads in several cases:
;;; 1) There are no nonlocal entrances (BLOCK/TAGBODYs) around the call in the function.
;;; 2) We have already caught an exception and determined it's not ours, or not for this frame.
;;; 3) The compiler knows the function being invoked will never return to this frame.
;;; The third is kind of hard - intrinsics can call ERROR and get a handler, for example - so
;;; we underutilize (FIXME) this optimization at the moment.

;;;; See unwind-notes.txt for more background on this system.
