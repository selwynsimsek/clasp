;;; ACCESSOR / READER / WRITER METHOD CREATION
;;;
;;; The following code creates unoptimized versions of the
;;; slot accessors defined for a class. They are designed so that at least
;;; some varieties work at boot time, but are called in normal system operation.
;;;
;;; There is not much optimization because fastgf can usually inline accesses anyway.
;;; The functions created here by std-class-accessors are set as the method functions
;;; of standard reader and writer methods, but these functions are only used
;;; if fastgf cannot optimize the access, which will only happen if there are
;;; additional user methods. In which case we have to go slowly anyway.
;;;
